This is a the data analysis end to end project for Zyad Ibrahim khalil
1) what'd you find in this file:

	- Dashboards:
		- this file contains the final dashboard after analyzing the cleaned and merged dataset, under the name of: People_and_occupations_report.pbix
		- User Guide for People_and_occupations_across_time_report: it's a user guide on how to interact with the dashboard 
	- dataset:
		-Old datasets: contains the two provided datasets
		-Resulted datasets: Contains the new dataset that is a result of merging and cleaning the two datasets

	- ETL pipeline:
		-ETL_pipeline: 
			-this file contains a jupyter noteboot that contains the process of loading, transforming, cleaning and merging the data, and finally loading it, in a form of a modularized data pipeline functions and the call of it
		-testing_lab: 
			- this file contains testing the ETL pipeline and testing the solutions of inconsistencies in the datasets, ****its not the main file***
	- Explratory Data Analysis
		- this file contains the process of exploring the datasets, and exploring their attributes and datatypes
		- there are also automated EDA for the two datasets, under the names of: 
			-Automated_EDA_report_for_data1.html
			-Automated_EDA_report_for_data2.html
